# AUT_MachineLearning_Projects
Assignments and project of Applied Machine Learning Course at AUT under supervision of Prof. Ehsan Nazerfard.

## Homework1
* implementation of linear Regression with gradient descent algorithm
* getting familiar with concepts such as: correlation, multivariate linear Regression, feature selection, Regularization, Normal Equation, ...
* implementaion of KNN and reporting accuracy, confusion matrix and plotting pictures.
## Homework2
* preprocess the data (e.g. handle missing values, encoding categorical variables,..)
* implementation of Decision Tree
## Homework3
* implementaion of Logistic Regression
* implementation of Naive Bayes Algorithm
## Homework3
* implementaion of SVM using python libraries (linear, polynomial, RBF and sigmoid kernels)
* implementation of Ensemble methods: RandomForest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting
* implementation of DBScan clustering Algorithm
## Final Project
* using Selenium library for web scraping.
* extract useful information from the texts using methods such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
* use the traditional networks to recognize the face.
